/**
 * End-to-end wiring check for Task 13 (Bazarr integration): hits the real
 * `/search` route through a booted kernel with the REAL BazarrSubtitleIndex.
 * Bazarr is unconfigured in the test env, so every lookup fails closed to
 * 'hidden' — see MediaControllerSearchSubtitleTest's class doc for why a
 * mocked 'missing'/'complete' response can't be exercised through a full
 * HTTP request here (BazarrSubtitleIndex gets eagerly resolved as a private
 * container service, via Twig's extension set, before any test body runs —
 * a pre-existing Turbo+Twig+Doctrine interaction). This still catches a real
 * class of regression: BazarrSubtitleIndex failing to inject into
 * MediaController, attachSubtitleStatus() never being called, or the route
 * crashing outright now that the constructor takes an extra argument.
