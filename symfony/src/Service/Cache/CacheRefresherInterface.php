/**
 * Owns the "how do I rebuild this cache entry" half of the SWR contract.
 * Implementations are collected by RefreshCacheKeyHandler through the
 * app.cache_refresher tag; EVERY refresher whose supports() answers true for
 * a key is called (see the handler's docblock for why "first match wins"
 * was rejected).
 *
 * Implementer obligations:
 *  - supports() domains MUST be mutually exclusive across all refreshers.
 *    Tagged-iterator order is container registration order, not a stable
 *    API, so relying on prefix shadowing (one refresher's prefix being a
 *    superset of another's) is not safe at any ordering. The handler logs a
 *    warning if two refreshers ever claim the same key, but that is a safety
 *    net for a misconfiguration, not something to design around.
 *  - Before doing any refresh work, check ServiceHealthCache::isDown() for
 *    the service you own and return immediately if it is down (guardrail 5:
 *    never hammer a service its own breaker just marked down).
 *  - Never persist (e.g. via StaleWhileRevalidateCache::write()) on a
 *    failed/empty fetch — leave the previous good value untouched
 *    (guardrail 6).
 *  - Be idempotent: re-read the current cache state first and return early
 *    if it is already fresh. A duplicate message can arrive from at-least-
 *    once transport delivery, and — see above — from an accidental
 *    supports() overlap.
