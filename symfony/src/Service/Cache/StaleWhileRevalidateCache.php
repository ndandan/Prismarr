/**
 * The one stale-while-revalidate primitive shared by every cached dataset.
 * Values live in cache.app (filesystem, atomic tmp+rename writes) as
 * {fetchedAt, value} envelopes with expiresAfter(hardTtl), so a hard miss ==
 * a pool miss.
 *
 * Two read paths on purpose:
 *   read()          — never fetches. For datasets a page can render without
 *                     (an optional badge, counter or side panel).
 *                     Structurally safe: any pool failure degrades to "no
 *                     cached data", never a 500, because this can sit
 *                     directly on the render path.
 *   getOrCompute()  — fetches inline on a hard miss, THROUGH the contracts
 *                     cache so Symfony's LockRegistry flock still gives
 *                     cross-worker single-flight, and with $beta = 0 so
 *                     probabilistic early expiration cannot fire a surprise
 *                     inline refill before the hard TTL. For datasets a page
 *                     cannot render without (the library lists).
 *
 * Refreshes never run in the web process: requestRefresh() sets a short
 * coalescing marker and dispatches RefreshCacheKey to the `async` transport,
 * consumed by the already-running messenger-worker s6 service.
