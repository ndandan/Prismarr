/**
 * radarrId/sonarrSeriesId -> Bazarr subtitle status lookup, for badge rendering.
 *
 * The badge read path (movieStatus/movieLanguages/seriesStatus) NEVER fetches
 * from Bazarr: a full-library fetch (`/movies?length=-1`, ~7 s on a large
 * library) is far too expensive to run inline behind a decorative badge that
 * renders up to 588 times on the Films page. Instead these three methods only
 * ever read `cache.app` through `StaleWhileRevalidateCache`:
 *   - fresh or stale data is served immediately (bounded staleness), and
 *   - a hard miss answers the new `pending` state and asks the
 *     messenger-worker (BazarrIndexRefresher, via RefreshCacheKey) to rebuild
 *     the dataset off the request path.
 *
 * A request-scoped memo (worker-mode safe via ResetInterface) still sits in
 * front of the pool so a single request's many badge renders cost one pool
 * read per dataset, not one per badge.
