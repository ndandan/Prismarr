 *

 * panels consume it (see the readers in App\Service\Unifi). The shell renders
 * with no upstream call at all, so first paint never waits on the console.
 *
 * Every action is read-only and every action answers 200. A monitoring page
 * that 500s because the monitored thing is sick is worse than useless.
