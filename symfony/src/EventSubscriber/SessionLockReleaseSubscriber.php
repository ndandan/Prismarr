/**
 * Releases the PHP session file lock as early as possible on read-only
 * requests, so concurrent requests don't serialise on it (issue: Unraid
 * lockups).
 *
 * Why this matters: PHP's native file session handler holds an exclusive
 * `flock` on the session file for the whole request. The firewall reads the
 * session once (on kernel.request) to authenticate; after that the dashboard
 * widgets, films/series pages, qBit and Usenet views never write to it, yet
 * the lock is kept until the response is sent. The dashboard fires ~6 widget
 * fragments in parallel, so they all block on the same session lock while
 * their slow Radarr/Sonarr calls run. On Unraid, the session file lives on
 * the FUSE share (`/mnt/user`, shfs), where `flock` contention is expensive
 * enough to peg every core and freeze the whole box.
 *
 * Closing the session right after the controller is resolved (auth already
 * done) drops the lock immediately, so the parallel fragments stop fighting
 * over it. We only do this for GET main requests: POSTs (CSRF mutations,
 * login, flash messages) keep the session open and write normally — except a
 * short allowlist of long-running POSTs known not to write it. The setup
 * wizard is excluded because it legitimately writes `_locale` to the session
 * on its language picker; internal routes (_profiler, _wdt) are skipped too.
