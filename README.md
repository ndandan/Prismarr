## About

**Prismarr** brings qBittorrent, Radarr, Sonarr, Prowlarr, Seerr and
TMDb together in a single modern Symfony interface. No more juggling six
tabs to manage your library.

It's not a replacement for Radarr or Sonarr - those run side by side and
keep doing what they do best. Prismarr is the unified control surface:
one search bar that hits the local library and TMDb, one calendar that
merges movie releases and episode airs, one dashboard that surfaces what
matters today (a recent download, a pending request, a trending pick),
and one settings page where every API key lives - never on disk in plain
text and never in environment variables.

The whole thing ships as a single Docker container with SQLite inside.
First boot opens a 7-step wizard: create the admin, plug your services in,
done. No external database, no Redis, no per-service `.env` files. Pull
the image, mount one volume, you're up.

Prismarr is created and maintained by [Shoshuo](https://github.com/Shoshuo).
This repository is a personal fork of it — see below for what's different.

## About this fork

This fork stays close to upstream (it merges upstream regularly and keeps
its code mergeable back), and everything general-purpose gets offered back
as an upstream PR. What lives here:

**Contributed back and merged upstream** — these started here and are now
part of the original project:

- Library-page performance rework (short-TTL library cache + batched `curl_multi` *arr calls) — [#56](https://github.com/Shoshuo/Prismarr/pull/56)
- CI/workflow modernisation with fork-friendly guards — [#59](https://github.com/Shoshuo/Prismarr/pull/59)
- Plex activity via Tautulli (dashboard widget + full Plex Activity page) and latency-aware health chips — [#60](https://github.com/Shoshuo/Prismarr/pull/60)
- In-place quick-look modal on the dashboard — [#61](https://github.com/Shoshuo/Prismarr/pull/61)
- Plex Activity statistics, graphs and per-user filter — [#62](https://github.com/Shoshuo/Prismarr/pull/62)

**Proposed upstream, pending** — already shipped in this fork:

- Dashboard theming: 17 glance-style HSL presets with an admin Theme picker — [#66](https://github.com/Shoshuo/Prismarr/pull/66)
- Dashboard layout customization: reorder + hide/show sections — [#68](https://github.com/Shoshuo/Prismarr/pull/68)
- One unified rich detail modal everywhere (top-bar search, dashboard, Explorer, Plex activity) — [#69](https://github.com/Shoshuo/Prismarr/pull/69)

**Fork-only** — outside upstream's scope, only available here:

- **Unraid server widget:** an admin-only dashboard section for the Unraid 7
  GraphQL API — array and disk health, parity status with live check progress
  and ETA, CPU/RAM/uptime, per-container Docker status chips, and UPS state.
- **Houndarr widget:** a read-only dashboard stat tile for
  [Houndarr](https://github.com/av1155/houndarr) backlog searching — tracked /
  eligible / cooldown / unreleased counts and 7-day searches, plus a health chip.
- Performance work ahead of upstream (not yet proposed): cross-request
  service-health caching, browser cache headers on static assets, and the
  prod cache pre-warmed at image build.

The full details live in [docs/FORK-CHANGES.md](docs/FORK-CHANGES.md) and the
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md). The fork is run daily on a real homelab (Unraid),
and every change lands through the same quality gate as upstream: PHP lint,
Twig lint and the full PHPUnit suite must be green in CI before an image is
published.

## Features

Everything upstream Prismarr does, plus the fork additions (marked **fork**):

- **Movies & Series:** Radarr and Sonarr libraries with five view modes, **multiple instances side by side** (1080p / 4K / Anime, each first-class in the UI), global `Ctrl+K` search and a quick-add modal with a per-instance target picker.
- **Unified calendar:** movie and episode releases merged across instances, deduped by `tmdbId` / `tvdbId`, with month / week / day views and iCal export.
- **Dashboard:** hero spotlight, upcoming releases, pending Seerr requests, live service health, watchlist, trending and latest additions. Paints instantly, each widget hydrates on its own.
- **Dashboard customization (fork):** an admin can reorder and hide/show every dashboard section, and pick one of 17 theme presets.
- **Quick-look everywhere (fork):** clicking any media tile — dashboard, top-bar search result, Explorer, Plex activity — opens one rich in-place detail modal (poster, synopsis, ratings, release/air dates, watchlist, Add/Manage deep-links) instead of navigating away.
- **Downloads:** full qBittorrent dashboard (server-side pagination, sorting, filters, drag-and-drop upload) plus dedicated SABnzbd and NZBGet pages. Optional Gluetun integration.
- **Discovery:** TMDb landing page with recommendations and trending, watchlist, an explorer with filters, and deep-links into your library.
- **Plex activity (Tautulli):** optional read-only page (now playing, watch stats, graphs with a per-user filter, history) plus a "Current Plex activity" dashboard widget. The API key stays server-side and responses are sanitised.
- **Unraid server monitoring (fork):** optional admin-only dashboard section — array/parity health with live check progress, disks, CPU/RAM, Docker containers and UPS, via the Unraid 7 GraphQL API.
- **Houndarr (fork):** optional dashboard stat tile with backlog-search totals and a health chip.
- **Preferences:** theme, UI density, timezone, date format, English / French UI, settings export / import (credentials always stripped).
- **Security:** Symfony auth with login rate-limiter, non-root container, dynamic CSP, SSRF protection on user-provided URLs, CSRF on every mutation.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- At least one of: qBittorrent, Radarr, Sonarr, Prowlarr, Seerr
- Optional: Gluetun if qBittorrent runs behind a VPN
- Optional: a TMDb API key (free) to enable the Discovery page
- Optional: a Tautulli instance (URL + API key) for the Plex activity page and widget
- Optional: an Unraid 7 server (GraphQL API key) for the server monitoring widget
- Optional: a Houndarr instance (URL + API key) for the backlog-search widget

### Which image?

| Image | What you get |
|---|---|
| `ghcr.io/ndandan/prismarr:latest` | **This fork** — upstream Prismarr plus everything listed above |
| `shoshuo/prismarr:latest` | The original upstream project (Docker Hub) |

The instructions below use the fork image. Both use the same volume layout,
so switching between them is just changing the `image:` line (back up first —
the fork may carry schema migrations upstream doesn't have yet).

### Install

**Step 1.** Create a file named `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  prismarr:
    image: ghcr.io/ndandan/prismarr:latest
    container_name: prismarr
    restart: unless-stopped
    stop_grace_period: 30s
    ports:
      - "7070:7070"
    volumes:
      - prismarr_data:/var/www/html/var/data

volumes:
  prismarr_data:
```

#### Bind-mount variant (Servarr-style layout)

If you prefer host folders next to your other Servarr containers (Radarr, Sonarr, etc.) for easy browsing, replace the named volume with a bind-mount. The container target must stay at `/var/www/html/var/data`:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./prismarr-config:/var/www/html/var/data
```

Drop the top-level `volumes:` block, and create the host folder before first start: `mkdir -p ./prismarr-config`.

> [!warning]
> If you write your own compose, the container target for the data volume must be `/var/www/html/var/data`. Prismarr does not use the Servarr `/config` or `/app/config` convention. A bind-mount on the wrong path silently creates an anonymous volume that resets on every redeploy, with no error in the logs.

> [!warning]
> **Unraid:** map the data volume to a dedicated subfolder on your **cache pool** (`/mnt/cache/appdata/prismarr`), not to `/mnt/user/...`. The `/mnt/user` share goes through FUSE (shfs), where session and database I/O can saturate the share. Prismarr releases the session lock early on read-only requests, which removes the worst of it, but a dedicated cache-pool subfolder (never the `appdata` root, so the startup `chown` stays scoped) remains the right mapping.

---

**Step 2.** Start the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Step 3.** Open `http://localhost:7070` in your browser. The setup wizard
will guide you through:

- admin account creation
- TMDb API key (optional)
- Radarr / Sonarr / Prowlarr / Seerr URLs and keys
- qBittorrent + Gluetun (optional)

Tautulli, Unraid and Houndarr are configured later from
**Settings → Services** (each with its own enable toggle and Test-connection
button).

`APP_SECRET` and `MERCURE_JWT_SECRET` are auto-generated on first boot and
persisted in the `prismarr_data` volume. No `.env` editing required.

### Default port

Prismarr listens on `7070`. To use a different port, change the left side of
the mapping in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:7070"  # access on http://localhost:8080
```

---

## Configuration

Everything is configured from the UI:

- **First boot**: the 7-step setup wizard at `/setup`
- **Later**: the Settings page at `/admin/settings` (admin only)

External service credentials (TMDb / Radarr / Sonarr / Prowlarr / Seerr /
Tautulli / Unraid / Houndarr API keys, qBittorrent password, service URLs),
display preferences and language are stored in the SQLite database
(`setting` table). They never appear in environment variables or in any
committable file.

Two framework-level secrets - `APP_SECRET` and `MERCURE_JWT_SECRET` - are
auto-generated on first boot and persisted inside the volume at
`var/data/.env.local`. They never leave the volume; you don't have to set,
rotate or back them up manually.

### Environment variables (optional)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_ENV` | `prod` | Switch to `dev` for local development only |
| `PRISMARR_PORT` | `7070` | Internal listening port |
| `TRUSTED_PROXIES` | `127.0.0.1,REMOTE_ADDR` | Adjust if running behind Traefik / nginx / Caddy / Cloudflare Tunnel |
| `TZ` | `UTC` | Container time zone (e.g. `Europe/Paris`, `Pacific/Honolulu`). Drives both the OS clock and the PHP date helpers — see upstream issue [#12](https://github.com/Shoshuo/Prismarr/issues/12) |
| `PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT` | `1024M` | PHP memory ceiling per request. Bump (e.g. `2048M`, `-1` for unlimited) if you have a very large Radarr / Sonarr library — see upstream issue [#13](https://github.com/Shoshuo/Prismarr/issues/13) |
| `PHP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME` | `120` | PHP wall-time ceiling per request, in seconds. Bump alongside `PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT` if the films / series page times out |

### Persistent data

Everything lives in the `prismarr_data` Docker volume:

- `prismarr.db` (SQLite database)
- `.env.local` (auto-generated secrets)
- `sessions/` (login sessions)
- `cache/` (TMDb / cover thumbnails)
- `avatars/` (uploaded user avatars)

A standard backup is `docker run --rm -v prismarr_data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar czf /backup/prismarr-data.tgz -C /data .`.

### Reverse proxy

Prismarr handles HSTS and Permissions-Policy headers itself. When sitting
behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS (Traefik, nginx, Caddy,
Cloudflare Tunnel), set `TRUSTED_PROXIES` to your proxy network so that
Symfony reads the right `X-Forwarded-*` headers.

---

## Upgrade

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

SQLite migrations run automatically on container start. The `prismarr_data`
volume is preserved.

### Image tags

The fork publishes two tags to GHCR, built by GitHub Actions:

- **`ghcr.io/ndandan/prismarr:latest`** — rebuilt from `main`. This is the
  stable fork build; nothing reaches `main` without green CI (lint + full
  PHPUnit suite) and a live test.
- **`ghcr.io/ndandan/prismarr:beta`** — pre-release builds of in-progress
  feature branches, used to test on a real deployment before merging.

> [!warning]
> **`:beta` can be broken, regress features, or lose data.** Do not run it on
> an instance you care about, and back up the `prismarr_data` volume before
> switching — a pre-release migration may not be reversible.

The fork does not cut versioned releases; for pinned semver tags, use the
upstream image (`shoshuo/prismarr:1.x.x`) — minus the fork-only features.

---

## Tech stack

- **Backend**: PHP 8.4 / Symfony 8 / Doctrine ORM
- **Server**: FrankenPHP (Caddy + PHP embed, worker mode) supervised by s6-overlay
- **Frontend**: Tabler UI + Alpine.js + Turbo (Hotwire) via Symfony AssetMapper
- **Database**: SQLite (zero-config, automatic Doctrine migrations)
- **Cache + sessions**: filesystem (no Redis required)
- **Queue**: Symfony Messenger (Doctrine transport)
- **Real-time**: Mercure SSE built into Caddy

A single Docker container ships everything. The fork's GHCR image is built
for `linux/amd64` (its target deployment is Unraid); the upstream Docker Hub
image also ships `arm64` if you need ARM.

---

## FAQ

**Why a fork?**
To add integrations the upstream project considers out of scope (Unraid
server monitoring, Houndarr) and to iterate on features before proposing
them upstream. Everything general-purpose is offered back as a PR — five
have been merged so far, and several more are open.

**Will this fork drift away from upstream?**
No — staying mergeable is an explicit goal. Upstream changes are merged in
regularly, upstream-origin code is left untouched even when fork changes
obsolete it, and fork features are built to sit on top rather than rewrite.

**Does Prismarr need internet access?**
Only for TMDb (cover art, metadata, discovery) and the services you point
it at. The app itself works fully on a LAN; if you don't configure TMDb,
the Discovery page is the only feature that goes dark.

**Can I run it behind a reverse proxy?**
Yes. Set `TRUSTED_PROXIES` to your proxy network (see Configuration).
HSTS and Permissions-Policy headers are emitted by the embedded Caddy.

**Where are my API keys stored? Is it safe?**
In the SQLite database (table `setting`). The database lives in the
`prismarr_data` Docker volume, never in environment variables, never
in any file under version control. The export feature strips every
key matching `api_key`, `password` or `secret` so accidentally
sharing your config is safe.

**How do I back up my install?**
Snapshot the `prismarr_data` Docker volume (one-liner in the
Configuration section). It contains the SQLite DB, the auto-generated
secrets, sessions, cache and avatars - everything needed to restore.

**Can I switch between the fork image and the upstream image?**
Yes, they share the same volume layout — but back up first. The fork can
carry database migrations upstream doesn't have yet, and a downgrade
across a migration may require restoring the backup.
